---
I'm an autodidactic entrepreneur with a background in management, who turned himself into a full stack web developer. Currently, I get my hands dirty at the intersection of design, development and marketing. What they call product management nowadays, right?

For the moment, I am working hard with my team on helping cities to tap into the collective intelligence of their citizens. CitizenLab is a citizensourcing platform on which citizens co-create their city. Have a look at [our website](http://citizenlab.co) to learn more.

My key areas of interest are co-creation, decentralisation, remote working, self-learning, product design, smart cities, online platforms, productivity and growth hacking. I am a digital nomad, who gets much of his inspiration from travelling to compelling countries such as Iran, Ethiopia, Israel and Palestine and Indonesia.

You can find me on Twitter [@WietseVR](http://twitter.com/wietsevr). 

Currently living in Tokyo, always up for a coffee to talk about startups, tech, design or journalism. :)
