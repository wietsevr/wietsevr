Autodidactic entrepreneur who turned himself into a full stack web developer. Loves the intersection of design, development and marketing. A passion for leveraging technology in order to decentralise services.

Currently working hard with my team on helping cities to tap into the collective intelligence of their citizens. CitizenLab is a citizensourcing platform on which citizens co-create their city. Have a look at http://citizenlab.co to learn more.

My key areas of interest are co-creation, decentralisation, remote working, self-learning, product design, smart cities, online platforms, productivity and growth hacking. I am digital nomad, who fell in love with Iran, Ethiopia and Indonesia.

You can find me on Twitter [@WietseVR](http://twitter.com/wietsevr). 

Currently living in Tokyo, always up for a coffee to talk about startups or tech.
